            <p>An Alert system that would help relay information between medical centers and traffics control authorities and helps them coordinate their efforts with the following features
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Prior alerts to vehicle-users in the path of the ambulance to ensure a hassle-free transition</li>
                <li>A chat-based feature where they can exchange relevant information</li>
                <li>Suggestions about faster, alternate routes for the ambulance</li>
                <li>Notifying the authorities about the ETA of the ambulances</li>
                <li>Provide assistance in directing the traffic in a way that would minimize congestion upon arrival of the ambulance</li>

            <p>According to Times of India about 146,133 people were killed in road accidents in India in the year 2016. Out of these about 30% of deaths are caused due to delayed ambulance.</p>
            <p>Another Indian government data shows more than 50% of heart attack cases reach hospital late, which can constitute unavailability of ambulances too but majority of it is due to patients stuck in traffic.</p>
            <p>Our aim is to send alerts to drivers and respective traffic entities to make way well before time to avoid traffic jams.</p>

            <p>This website aims to simulate the process of delivering alerts based on one's category and location.</p>
            <p>It asks for your (category?) as either a (categories here) and takes your location. If you're a 4-wheeler driver, an alert is sent to you if your current location coincides with the path ambulance is taking.</p>
            <p>If you're an ambulance driver, a path is taken as an input and chatting previlages are given to communicate with the respective traffic entity to plan a free path ahead (in addition to an alert sent to the 4-wheelers).</p>
